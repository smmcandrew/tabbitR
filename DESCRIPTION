    person("Siobhan", "McAndrew", email="siobhan.mcandrew@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Produces weighted crosstabulation tables for one or more outcome 
    variables across one or more breakdown variables, and exports them directly 
    to Excel. For each outcome-by-breakdown combination, the package creates a 
    weighted percentage table and a corresponding unweighted count table, with 
    transparent handling of missing values and light, readable formatting. 
    Designed to support social survey analysis workflows that require large sets of 
    consistent, publication-ready tables.
